# Program Description
## My ICS3U Final: a tile-based rpg game 

# Features
- player sprite's objective is to interact with final non-player character sprite
- player sprite is able to attack enemies
- player sprite dies through enemy collision
- player and non-player character sprite collision results in npc sprite not moving as well as a text dialogue popping up providing context 
- player sprite is able to move through stages through a teleporter
- player sprite is not able to move through walls

# Installation
#### Use the package manager **pip** to install pygame.
> pip install pygame

# Known Bugs
- when colliding with non-player character, a text dialogue should blit onto the screen; however, there is a flickering effect 
- so it is commented out currently

# Cheat Codes
- approach enemy sprites slowing, and the last key that is pressed is the direction you are facing
- this will result in a attack in that direction if chosen to do so
